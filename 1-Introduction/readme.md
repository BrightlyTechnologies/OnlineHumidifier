# Introduction

Each winter I am getting concerned about humidity in my home. When it is cold outside we keep the windows closed most of the time so humidity is going either too high or too low. This depends on your heating system, ventilation, how often you cook, take shower, wash and couple of other factors.

To reduce excessive humidity you can use [dehumidifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumidifier). If it is too low you can increase it with a [humidifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidifier).
You can [ask google to find recommended level of humidity](http://www.azosensors.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=487) so you and your family feel comfortable and your window panes do not getting fogged.

My optimum humidity level is about 40 - 45%. During autumn it stays about 45% - 50% if it is raining outside and temperature is high enough so I can keep the windows open. During winter it quickly drops below 30% unless I use humidifier.

My humidifier has manual control which makes great opportunity for a home automation project. The plan is to measure humidity and if it is below desired target value - turn the humidifier automatically on. In opposite situation, if humidity is above targetâ€“ turn humidifier off.

The task for this automatic control is to maintain target humidity no matter how often I open windows or boil water for a cup of tea.

This GitHub repository is to show step by step how to do it. Check it out - this is not difficult, does not cost much at all and you will have fun and satisfaction making it happen.
